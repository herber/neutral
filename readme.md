Welcome to neutral's proposal repo. Neutral is a work in progress framework by <a href="https://twitter.com/tobiasherber_">Tobias Herber</a>. This repo documents, what I want neutral to be.

## About

Neutral is a (mostly) unopinionated JavaScript framework / stack for modern applications. It is built to be minimalist, without skipping any features.

__Why another framework__

Well, there are about a trillion frameworks out there, it does not matter if there is another one.

## Features

 - __Minimal__: The whole neutral stack is built to be as small as possible, while shipping all the features you need.
 - __Easy to learn__: Neutral does not reinvent the wheel, so you don't have to learn much.
 - __Minimal tooling__: Neutral comes with it's very own toolchain, powered by [browserify](browserify.org) and [rollup](rollupjs.org).
 - __Isomorphic__: Neutral does not care if it's running on the server or on the client

## Philosophy

I believe that development should be easy, fast and accessible. A framework is something very personal, because everyone has different opinions, that's why neutral is built around useful presets, not opinions. Frameworks should be built to help you, not to force you to built you apps how the framework's developers wanted you to.

Everything should be reusable, that's why even neutral is built with reusable components. Your applications should consist of small reusable components. A component is just a function, not a class!

You should not have to lean a huge new api, just to use a new framework, neutral only comes with a few methods and only mostly uses technologies you already know, this way getting started is easy.

## Parts and modules

 - A router
 - Something for state management
 - A tool for morphing dom nodes
