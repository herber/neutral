## About

Neutral is a (mostly) unopinionated JavaScript framework / stack for modern applications. It is built to be minimalist, without skipping any features.

__Why another framework__

Well, there are about a trillion frameworks out there, it does not matter if there is another one.

## Features

 - __Minimal__: The whole neutral stack is built to be as small as possible, while shipping all the features you need.
 - __Easy to learn__: Neutral does not reinvent the wheel, so you don't have to learn much.
 - __Minimal tooling__: Neutral comes with it's very own toolchain, powered by [browserify](browserify.org) and [rollup](rollupjs.org).
 - __Isomorphic__: Neutral does not care if it's running on the server or on the client

## Parts and modules

 - A router
 - Something for state management
 - A tool for morphing dom nodes
